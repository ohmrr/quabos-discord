# üëΩ Quabos 

Quabos is an entertainment Discord bot built with TypeScript, Discord.js v14 and MongoDB. Using a Markov chaining algorithm, it will read in messages sent in your server and generate its own messages. Quabos is heavily inspired by the [nMarkov bot](https://nmarkov.vixenteam.xyz/).

## üåô Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- [Discord Developer Portal Bot Token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
- [Free MongoDB Atlas Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/)

## üõ∏ Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ohmrr/quabos-discord.git
cd quabos-discord
pnpm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

In the packages/bot directory, you can create or rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
Fill out all of the values with your Discord Bot Token, and with your MongoDB connection string.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never share your connection string or discord token with anyone. Also ensure that your .env file is not being tracked by Git.**

```sh
CONNECTION_STRING=""
DISCORD_TOKEN=""

NODE_ENV="" # Can be either "development" or "production"
DEV_GUILD_ID="" # If NODE_ENV is development, you will need a development discord server
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

```sh
cd packages/bot
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

This will transpile the TypeScript code to JavaScript, and then start your own instance of Quabos as long as you have followed the above steps correctly.
